# Introduction

Syringe is a lightweight dependency(DI) framework written in Swift. It aims to provide an intuitive and non-invasive way to realise Inversion of Control(IoC) in applications written in Swift.

Unlike other dependency frameworks, Syringe aims for simplicity and ease-of-use via an extensive custom DSL. 

The core features of Syringe:
- Full-features dependency injection
- Intuitive and clever custom DSL
- Non-invasive:
    - No property wrappers
    - No code-generation
    - Only use Syringe where you need to
- Tested on macOS, Windows and Linux.
